In this project, I used a raw dataset to predict whether a person will likely have diabetes based on key health-related features.
Key Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing:
   Handled categorical data by converting them into numerical values using Ordinal Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Label Encoding from sklearn.
2. Model Training:
  Trained three machine learning models to make predictions: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
3. Comparison & Evaluation:
Compared the model's performance to determine the most effective approach for diabetes prediction.
