# Traffic Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on forecasting traffic conditions using historical traffic data and machine learning techniques. Accurate traffic prediction can aid urban planners and commuters by providing insights into traffic congestion patterns, enabling better traffic management and resource allocation.

## Project Description

The repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that performs the following:

- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:** Loading traffic datasets, handling missing or inconsistent data, and transforming date/time fields for time-series analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization and analysis of traffic trends across different temporal and environmental variables such as day of the week, hour of day, and weather conditions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of relevant features to improve model predictive performance.
- **Model Development & Training:** Implementation of machine learning models to predict traffic volume, including data splitting, training, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Evaluation:** Quantitative assessment of model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and visualization of predicted versus actual traffic values.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sha-diya/Data_Science_Projects.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Data_Science_Projects/Traffic\ Prediction
```
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Traffic_prediction.ipynb
```
4. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to explore the data analysis and traffic prediction pipeline.
